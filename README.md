# Bank Management System UML Project

This project is a UML-based design and implementation of a Bank Management System. The system is designed to help bank staff manage customer accounts, transactions, and provide various banking services.

List of Diagrams:

• Use Case Diagram: Shows the various actors and use cases of the system, including bank staff, customers, and various services such as account opening, fund transfer, and loan application.<br>
• Class Diagram: Depicts the various classes, their attributes, and methods in the system, such as Account, Customer, and Transaction.<br>
• Sequence Diagram: Illustrates the interaction between different objects in the system and the sequence of actions they take to complete a specific task, such as transferring funds between accounts.<br>
• Collaboration Diagram: Shows the communication between different objects in the system and the relationship between them to accomplish a particular task, such as depositing money into a customer's account.<br>
• State Chart Diagram: Represents the different states of an object and how it transitions between them, such as the state of a loan application.<br>
• Activity Diagram: Illustrates the flow of activities in the system, including the sequence of actions and decision points, such as the process of account opening.<br>
• Component Diagram: Displays the various components that make up the system and how they interact with each other, such as the database, web server, and application server.<br>
• Deployment Diagram: Depicts the physical deployment of the system's components, such as the database server and web server, and their interconnection.<br>
• Package Diagram: Shows the different packages and their relationships within the system, such as the package containing all the classes related to customer management.<br>

This project is a comprehensive and detailed UML design for a Bank Management System. The diagrams provide an excellent understanding of the system's structure, behavior, and interactions. This project can be used as a reference for software developers who want to develop similar systems or as a learning resource for students who are studying UML design.
